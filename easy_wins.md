# Easy Wins for Spending Analyser

This document outlines several "easy wins" - improvements that can be made to the Spending Analyser project with minimal effort but significant impact.

## Code Structure and Organization

### 1. Rename `setup.py` to `setup_db.py`
- **Issue**: `setup.py` is conventionally used for Python package configuration, not database setup.
- **Solution**: Rename to `setup_db.py` to better reflect its purpose.
- **Benefit**: Avoids confusion with standard Python packaging conventions.

### 2. Add Type Hints
- **Issue**: Most functions lack type hints, making it harder to understand expected inputs/outputs.
- **Solution**: Add type annotations to function parameters and return values.
- **Benefit**: Improved code readability, better IDE support, and potential for catching type-related bugs.

### 3. Create a Database Module
- **Issue**: Database operations are scattered across different files.
- **Solution**: Create a dedicated database module with CRUD operations.
- **Benefit**: Better separation of concerns and reusable database operations.

## Error Handling

### 4. Add Error Handling to API Endpoints
- **Issue**: The `/transactions` endpoint doesn't handle potential exceptions.
- **Solution**: Implement try-except blocks and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Benefit**: More robust API that gracefully handles errors.

### 5. Add Validation for CSV Ingestion
- **Issue**: The CSV ingestion process assumes the file exists and has the correct format.
- **Solution**: Add validation for file existence and format before processing.
- **Benefit**: Prevents crashes when processing invalid files.

## Documentation

### 6. Add Docstrings to Functions and Classes
- **Issue**: Many functions and classes lack proper documentation.
- **Solution**: Add docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Benefit**: Easier for new developers to understand the codebase.

### 7. Update README with Accurate Commands
- **Issue**: The README mentions `python setup.db` but the file is named `setup.py`.
- **Solution**: Update the README to use the correct command or rename the file.
- **Benefit**: Prevents confusion for new users.

## Testing

### 8. Increase Test Coverage
- **Issue**: Some parts of the codebase lack comprehensive tests.
- **Solution**: Add tests for edge cases and error conditions.
- **Benefit**: More reliable code and easier refactoring.

### 9. Add Integration Tests
- **Issue**: Only unit tests exist; no tests for the entire workflow.
- **Solution**: Create integration tests that test the full process from CSV ingestion to API retrieval.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the system works as a whole.

## Security

### 10. Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data
- **Issue**: Database URL is loaded from environment but no example or documentation is provided.
- **Solution**: Add a `.env.example` file showing required environment variables.
- **Benefit**: Better security practices and easier setup for new developers.

### 11. Add Input Sanitization
- **Issue**: No validation or sanitization of CSV data before database insertion.
- **Solution**: Add validation to prevent SQL injection or other security issues.
- **Benefit**: Improved security against malicious data.

## Performance

### 12. Batch Database Operations
- **Issue**: Transactions are added to the database one at a time during ingestion.
- **Solution**: Use bulk insert operations for better performance.
- **Benefit**: Faster processing of large CSV files.

### 13. Add Database Indexing
- **Issue**: Only the primary key is indexed.
- **Solution**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields like date and category.
- **Benefit**: Faster query performance.

## User Experience

### 14. Add Pagination to API Endpoints
- **Issue**: The `/transactions` endpoint returns all transactions at once.
- **Solution**: Implement pagination to limit the number of results per request.
- **Benefit**: Better performance and usability for large datasets.

### 15. Add Filtering and Sorting Options
- **Issue**: No way to filter or sort transactions via the API.
- **Solution**: Add query parameters for filtering by date, category, etc.
- **Benefit**: More flexible and useful API.

## Dependencies

### 16. Pin Dependency Versions
- **Issue**: Requirements.txt specifies exact versions which may lead to compatibility issues.
- **Solution**: Use version ranges (e.g., `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`) for non-critical dependencies.
- **Benefit**: Easier updates and maintenance.

### 17. Add Development Dependencies
- **Issue**: No separation between production and development dependencies.
- **Solution**: Create a `requirements-dev.txt` for testing and development tools.
- **Benefit**: Cleaner production deployments.

## Deployment

### 18. Add Docker Support
- **Issue**: No containerization support for consistent deployment.
- **Solution**: Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy containerization.
- **Benefit**: Consistent environment across development and production.

### 19. Add CI/CD Configuration
- **Issue**: No automated testing or deployment pipeline.
- **Solution**: Add GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD configuration.
- **Benefit**: Automated testing and deployment process.

## Feature Enhancements

### 20. Support for More Banks
- **Issue**: Only Monzo statements are supported.
- **Solution**: Add parsers for other common bank statement formats.
- **Benefit**: Broader user base and more useful application.
